# signatureDetection
Handwritten signature detection using CV

## Dataset
For the best result the dataset used in the training is composed of images from pre-existing datasets and data on wich the model will be used on in practice.  
Every image is labelled with the bounding box of the signature, if one is present.  
To reduce the bias half of the examples present a signature, and half do not.
